Prokaryotic Argonautes are programmable nucleases involved in cell defense against invading DNA. Recent studies showed that Argonautes can bind small guide DNAs (gDNAs) to recognize and cleave complementary DNA in vitro and preferentially target plasmids, phages and multicopy genetic elements in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that Argonaute-dependent cleavage of specific genomic loci with plasmid-derived gDNAs promotes recombination between plasmid and chromosomal DNA in bacteria. Using CbAgo nuclease from *Clostridium butyricum* we show that efficient genome cleavage and recombineering depends on the catalytic activity of CbAgo, its interactions with gDNAs, and the extent of homology between plasmid and chromosomal sequences. Specific targeting of plasmids with Argonautes can be used to integrate plasmid-encoded sequences into the chromosome thus enabling genome editing.
